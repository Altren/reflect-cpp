**reflect-cpp** is a C++-20 library for fast serialization and deserialization using compile-time reflection, similar to [serde](https://github.com/serde-rs) in Rust, [pydantic](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic) in Python, [encoding](https://github.com/golang/go/tree/master/src/encoding) in Go or [aeson](https://github.com/haskell/aeson/tree/master) in Haskell.

As the aformentioned libraries are among the most widely used in the respective languages, reflect-cpp fills an important gap in C++ development. It reduces boilerplate code and increases code safety.

Design principles for reflect-cpp include:

- Close integration with containers from the C++ standard library
- Close adherence to C++ idioms
- Out-of-the-box support for JSON, no dependencies
- Simple installation: If no JSON support is required, reflect-cpp is header-only. For JSON support, only a single source file needs to be compiled.
- Simple extendability to other serialization formats
- Simple extendability to custom classes
- No macros

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <rfl/json.hpp>
#include <rfl.hpp>

// "firstName", "lastName", "birthday" and "children" are the field names
// as they will appear in the JSON. The C++ standard is
// snake case, the JSON standard is camel case, so the names
// will not always be identical.
struct Person {
    rfl::Field<"firstName", std::string> first_name;
    rfl::Field<"lastName", std::string> last_name;
    rfl::Field<"birthday", rfl::Timestamp<"%Y-%m-%d">> birthday;
    rfl::Field<"children", std::vector<Person>> children;
};

const auto bart = Person{.first_name = "Bart",
                         .last_name = "Simpson",
                         .birthday = "1987-04-19",
                         .children = std::vector<Person>()};

const auto lisa = Person{
    .first_name = "Lisa",
    .last_name = "Simpson",
    .birthday = "1987-04-19",
    .children = rfl::default_value  // same as std::vector<Person>()
};

// Returns a deep copy of the original object,
// replacing first_name.
const auto maggie =
    rfl::replace(lisa, rfl::make_field<"firstName">(std::string("Maggie")));

const auto homer =
    Person{.first_name = "Homer",
           .last_name = "Simpson",
           .birthday = "1987-04-19",
           .children = std::vector<Person>({bart, lisa, maggie})};

// We can now transform this into a JSON string.
const std::string json_string = rfl::json::write(homer);

std::cout << json_string << std::endl;
```

This results in the following JSON string:

```json
{"firstName":"Homer","lastName":"Simpson","birthday":"1987-04-19","children":[{"firstName":"Bart","lastName":"Simpson","birthday":"1987-04-19","children":[]},{"firstName":"Lisa","lastName":"Simpson","birthday":"1987-04-19","children":[]},{"firstName":"Maggie","lastName":"Simpson","birthday":"1987-04-19","children":[]}]}
```

We can also create structs from the string:

```cpp
auto homer2 = rfl::json::read<Person>(json_string).value();

// Fields can be accessed like this:
std::cout << "Hello, my name is " << homer.first_name() << " "
          << homer.last_name() << "." << std::endl;

// Since homer2 is mutable, we can also change the values like this:
homer2.first_name = "Marge";

std::cout << "Hello, my name is " << homer2.first_name() << " "
          << homer2.last_name() << "." << std::endl;
```

## Support for containers

### C++ standard library

reflect-cpp supports the following containers from the C++ standard library:

- `std::array` 
- `std::deque` 
- `std::forward_list` 
- `std::map` 
- `std::list` 
- `std::optional`
- `std::pair`
- `std::set`
- `std::shared_ptr`
- `std::string`
- `std::tuple`
- `std::unique_ptr` 
- `std::unordered_map` 
- `std::unordered_set` 
- `std::variant`
- `std::vector`

### Additional containers

In addition, it includes the following custom containers:

- `rfl::Box`: Similar to `std::unique_ptr`, but guaranteed to never be null.
- `rfl::Literal`: An explicitly enumerated string.
- `rfl::NamedTuple`: Similar to `std::tuple`, but with named fields that can be retrieved via their name at compile time.
- `rfl::Ref`: Similar to `std::shared_ptr`, but guaranteed to never be null. 
- `rfl::TaggedUnion`: Similar to `std::variant`, but with explicit tags that make parsing more efficient.

### Custom classes

Finally, it is very easy to extend full support to your own classes, refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/getml/reflect-cpp/tree/main/docs) for details.

## Serialization formats

reflect-cpp currently supports the following serialization formats:

- **JSON**: Out-of-the-box support, no additional dependencies required.
- **XML**: Requires [libxml2](https://github.com/GNOME/libxml2) (TODO).
- **flexbuffers**: Requires [flatbuffers](https://github.com/google/flatbuffers) (TODO).

reflect-cpp is deliberately designed in a very modular format, using [concepts](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constraints), to make it as easy as possible to support additional serialization formats. Refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/getml/reflect-cpp/tree/main/docs) for details (TODO). PRs related to serialization formats are welcome.

## Documentation

Click [here](https://github.com/getml/reflect-cpp/tree/main/docs).

## Current status

At the moment, this is work-in-progress. Here are some things that are still missingï¼š

- Benchmarks and optimization
- Documentation is unfinished (missing rfl::Result, rfl::NamedTuple as well as extension to other serialization formats)
- Support for MSVC

## Installation

The following compilers are supported:
- GCC 11.4 or higher
- Clang 14.0 or higher
- MSVC (TODO)

### Option 1: Header-only

If you **do not** need JSON support, then reflect-cpp is header-only. Simply copy the contents of the folder `include` into your source repository or add it to your include path.

### Option 2: Include source files into your own build

Simply copy the contents of the folder `include` into your source repository or add it to your include path and also add `src/yyjson.c` to your source files for compilation.

If you need support for other serialization formats like XML or flexbuffers, you should also include and link the respective libraries, as listed in the previous section.

### Option 3: Compilation using cmake 

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Compiling the tests

To compile the tests, do the following:

```
cd tests
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
